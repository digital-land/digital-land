### Show and Tell
**Time:** 22 November 2018  
**Location:** City Hall, London

We held a discovery workshop hosted by the GLA with friends from TFL and Southwark to walk through our joint approach for [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions).

### Show and Tell
**Time:** 15 November 2018  
**Location:** First Floor SW, Fry Building

Matt showed his approach for wrangling people's needs of [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions) data using a shared-document. Paul thinks this approach is worthy of a blog post.

Matt has also been prototyping a developer contributions dashboard using Google Data Studio and a GOV.UK-ish stylesheet. Michael showed new guidance he has been drafting to help planning authorities publish their brownfield site registers, and some enhancements to the validator tool. Paul showed a flyer he'd made for an internal event.
