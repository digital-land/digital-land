The team has been working on the [brownfield sites validator](https://brownfield-sites-validator.cloudapps.digital/) iterating the data model so we can understand the history of changes to registers. Of the 381 registers we have found 339 published, only 20 meet the standard, 5 with no errors. Over the course of the past two months, 32 have been moved or gone missing. We’re working on better guidance and tools to help publishers meet the standard.

We also had a quick show-and-tell with the implementation unit before talking about the golden thread recommendation from the [Hackitt review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety-final-report).

Paul blogged about the [difficulties of making data from information, and cake](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/25/data-and-information/).
