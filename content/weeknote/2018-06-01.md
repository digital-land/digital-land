More than 40 people came to our [open meeting](https://attending.io/events/what-land-and-housing-data-do-you-need) where we gleaned many insights from users of land and housing data. Next week the team are focussing their research on analysing the state of data in brownfield registers, how they are being maintained, and if they meets the needs of users.
