We are delighted to welcome [Helena Trippe](https://twitter.com/hptrippe) to our team as our new service designer!

The primary focus for the team this week was getting the [developer contribution project](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions) ready for public consultation, the date has yet to be agreed.

We’ve updated the [project page]((https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions)) to include a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pvblp8l4ODFmv91yyktArGaiskVnJgFcWDCYBBRgc2A/edit), and for areas where we have outstanding questions or concerns we’ve created a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/digital-land/digital-land/issues). We’ve aso written some [draft guidance](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/developer-contributions/) to help people publish their data. We plan to test this guidance early in the new year.
