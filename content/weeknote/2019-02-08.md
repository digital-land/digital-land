Following the three workshops we held last week for our project on [developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/), this week the team were analysing the findings and putting together an approach to further iterate our design.

Elsewhere, Paul attended the LDCU roadshow in Bristol and held a session on our data mission with local government colleagues.
