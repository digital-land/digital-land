Great news this week - EPC data is now being updated and published again on [Open Data Communities](https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/), thanks to a lot of hard work over the past year from policy specialists, including Ed. Read [Paul's blog post](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/18/publishing-energy-performance-certificate-data/) on our user research and policy work involved in resuming the publication of EPC data.

Helena and Paul B presented their research on local plans to the team and policy colleagues from the planning directorate. The discovery has identified a number of opportunities for making data available throughout the local plan making process. Our next step is to form alpha projects, in particular to raise the visibility of the status and contents of local plans.

Jake’s been working on the [brownfield sites validator](https://github.com/digital-land/validator-serverless) and is looking at ways to decouple it into a reusable service for [compulsory purchase orders](/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) and [developer contributions](/project/developer-contributions/), whilst Christine has been working on the brownfield sites validator URL updater. 

A few of us went to [Civil Service Live](https://www.civilservicelive.com/), attending talks on a range of topics such as using voice to search on GOV.UK, and how the Met Office uses cloud data storage.

Finally, a huge congratulations to Rebecca for graduating on Thursday with a Distinction in her MBA!
