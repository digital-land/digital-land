This week the team worked on preparing for the three workshops we are holding next week on [developer contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/), to test the data standard with users and get feedback. We are also preparing for two user research workshops on [local plans](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/), one with internal MHCLG policy users and one with external users, to better understand the user needs and problems that need to be solved.

Emily from [MySociety](https://mysociety.org) hotdesked with our team on Monday, and will be doing so one day a week from now on. She’s written a [blog post](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/kicking-off-the-planning-permissions-project/) about the project kickoff for the [central register of planning applications](https://www.mysociety.org/2019/01/14/an-examination-of-the-aggregation-of-planning-application-information/) project.

We’re keen to have MySociety - and others we are working with - participate in our fortnightly show and tells, and will making this happen more regularly in the coming months. We are talking to a lot of external stakeholders at the moment about how we can work together. This week we met with [Arup](https://www.arup.com/) and with the CEO and Chairman of [New London Architecture](https://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/).
