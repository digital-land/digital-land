We were joined this week by [Matt Lucht](https://twitter.com/mattlucht), our new delivery manager, Michael Nottingham, our new part-time content editor and by [Alex Blandford](https://twitter.com/blangry), a user researcher working for Rose. We’ve begun to write-up our discovery findings which we plan to present on the 28th and publish publicly on our new blog shortly afterwards.
