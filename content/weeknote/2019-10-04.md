Much of this week has been focussed on planning. Lorna, Matt and Helena have been lining up local authorities for our [Developer Contributions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/) private beta, and preparing for testing [Compulsory Purchase Orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) in a usability lab.

Emily and Michael worked with Helena on a redseign for our project pages, which we aim to deploy next week, starting with the end of discovery reports for [Local Plans](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/), and
 [Planning Permissions](https://digital-land.github.io/project/single-register-of-planning/).

There were several short-notice policy commissions which were quickly turned around by Natalie and Ed.
We also worked on simplifying our roadmap which we aim to make public soon.

## [Brownfield Sites](https://digital-land.github.io/project/brownfield-sites/)

As a part of our learning how to collect and improve distributed registers, Jake quickly made a national <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/brownfield-sites-map/">map of brownfield sites</a>.
Many of the sites are located outside of the local authority's boundary, in Northern Ireland, at the bottom-left corner of [British National Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid), and scattered across Africa and Asia. The map illustrates the boring work still needed to fix and harmonise the data.

## Events

Paul and Matt visited the [Open Data Institute (ODI)](https://theodi.org/) to talk about the team's work with a delegation of people working in local government from Slovakia and the Ukraine. There was some amusement at the brownfield sites misplaced in the Ukraine.

Lorna, Natalie and Jess attended the [New Methods conference](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/new-digital-tools-conference-city-hall-30-september-2019-tickets-67465030723) at City Hall, where they heard about a wide variety of data-related projects across Local Authorities. They were surprised to see [an old tweet from Paul](https://twitter.com/psd/status/258414355056562178) in Mike Bracken's presentation.

Thursday, Paul celebrated the official launch of [Colouring London](https://colouringlondon.org/) at the [Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)](https://www.rics.org/uk/). Colouring London. It's a lovely project, one we're pleased to be able to support.
