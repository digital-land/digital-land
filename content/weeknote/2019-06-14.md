This week, we spent Tuesday and Wednesday together at our Team Away days. We kicked off with a team retrospective, which led to discussions around building further relationships with policy teams and how to improve the delivery of products we're working on. We also went to the [Imaginary Cities exhibition at the British Library](https://www.bl.uk/events/imaginary-cities) and were joined by Lorna, our new user researcher.

Rebecca met with policy teams to talk about how we capture policy needs in our team planning, and met with Cities and Local Growth (CLOG) team to action things from last weeks [One Team Gov wellbeing camp](https://medium.com/oneteamgov/one-team-gov-wellbeing-camp-411c409946df).

Jake and Emily spent the week preparing for and attended the Energy Performance of Buildings alpha assessment with the Digital Delivery team.

Christine has been working out the next steps for the register tools with Adam, Matt and Colm.

Matt wrote a draft offer document for empty buildings project, and met with Campaign to Protect Rural England to discuss their needs around brownfield land data.

Rebecca and Ed also attended Christine's weekly code club, focusing on [Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) and [Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)).
