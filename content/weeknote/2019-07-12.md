This week Paul D spoke at the [PlanTech - July Breakfast Show & Tell](https://cp.catapult.org.uk/events/plantech-july-breakfast-show-tell/) at the ODI in Leeds, and attended the [Compulsory Purchase Association conference](https://cptevents.co.uk/event/the-cpa-national-conference-2019).

Our [compulsory purchase orders](/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/) has seen some progress this week. Matt met with the data protection team to explore options for publishing decision letters and inspectors reports, and we've also drafted a data model for the register which we'll test next week.

Helena and Paul B have been working on finalising analysis for the [local plans](/project/local-plans/) discovery, including defining user needs and hypotheses for potential opportunity areas. They also  shared their work on local plans at the digital showcase alongside John Romanski.

Jake, Christine, Adam and Colm have been working on the [brownfield sites validator](https://brownfield-sites-status.herokuapp.com). It’s now possible to change a URL for a brownfield land register on our master list, and the brownfield sites registers are checked daily.

This week Emily is on holiday, but Michael was in and completed GOV.UK Content Design Academy training - a prerequisite for getting a Whitehall publisher account, which will allow him to publish Digital Land's guidance on GOV.UK. He also made amends to the front page and About section of the website and began updating the timelines of several project pages so they reflect the team's activities of the past sprint.

Finally, we have a new starter - [Lorna Howes](https://twitter.com/hadronarly) - who has joined us as a user researcher.
