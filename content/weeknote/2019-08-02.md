Paul D presented at a couple of boards and attended the [Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI)](https://www.rtpi.org.uk/) workshop at [Connected Places Catapult](https://cp.catapult.org.uk/). 

Paul and Emily also held interviews for a new senior user researcher to join the Digital Land team.

Rebecca spent a day visiting the delivery manager community at GDS along with the other MHCLG delivery managers, to share experiences of agile teams working in a policy department.

Natalie and Ed met with the [Geospatial Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/geospatial-commission) to discuss collaboration on work that builds on our Local Plans discovery. Monthly catch ups have been organised to improve cross-Whitehall coordination on work relating to local plans, as well as future projects.

Lorna has finalised the user research plan for talking to local authorities about [compulsory purchase orders](https://digital-land.github.io/project/compulsory-purchase-orders/), and has also started drafting ethics guidance for the digital department's user research community.
