This week the Digital Land Service and the Planning Infrastructure policy team ran 3 workshops with local planning authority representatives focusing on [developer contributions](https://digital-land-github.io/project/developer-contributions). The public consultation on developer contributions has just closed, but we’ll be continuing to seek input from all stakeholders through forums like these as well as other channels.

Held in London, Leeds and Birmingham, the workshops helped the Digital Land team better understand how planning authorities manage developer contributions, what challenges they face and what opportunities they can see in opening up developer contribution data. We were also able to test the proposed data standard for developer contributions as well as our prototyped tools and guidance.

We gained a lot of insights from the workshops that will help us iterate the data standard, tools and guidance so that they ultimately improve the quality of data while adding as little as possible to authorities’ workload.
