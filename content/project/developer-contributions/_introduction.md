We've been working with local planning authorities to design a data format for publishing developer contributions. Otherwise known as planning obligations, developer contributions are commitments to improving local community infrastructure that developers agree with planning authorities. They include but are not limited to Section 106 agreements, viability assessments and community infrastructure levies. The new data format should help make developer contributions data easier to find, understand, use and trust. 

This work is part of a larger effort to improve the system of developer contributions by making it more transparent, accountable and effective. A [public consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/developer-contributions-reform-technical-consultation) on the technical implementation of proposed reforms ran until 31 January.
