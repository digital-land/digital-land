summary: The EPB team are building a service to help users easily find an energy certificate or assessor, and we’ve also been working to open up the data held in EPCs.

Finding an energy certificate or an energy assessor for a building is being made easier thanks to a new online service. A prototype being developed by the energy performance of buildings (EPB) team within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) Digital Directorate lets users search:

* by postcode or accreditation number for an energy assessor 
* by postcode or certificate reference for 3 types of energy certificate, including the [energy performance certificate (EPC)](https://www.gov.uk/buy-sell-your-home/energy-performance-certificates)

Previously if someone wanted to find an EPC they had to use the [EPC register](https://www.epcregister.com/). Testing showed, however, that users found this tool confusing.

The new service recently passed its GOV.UK alpha assessment and is moving into the beta stage of development, which involves making improvements based on testing with users.

## Publishing EPC data

Energy certificates are built on a rich source of housing data. However, recent changes in data privacy regulations meant that MHCLG stopped updating and publishing the raw data from EPCs.

Our research showed that there is a need for this data. For example, as well as telling people how to save energy and money, EPCs are also the primary source of bulk open data on a property’s floor area in square metres. Further investigation revealed that publishing this data is allowed under the privacy regulations, so the Digital Land team’s policy specialists recommended resuming publication of EPC data. As a result, the data is now available on [Open Data Communities](https://epc.opendatacommunities.org/) and will be updated every 6 months.

[Read our blog](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/18/publishing-energy-performance-certificate-data/) to find out more about the user research and policy work involved in opening up EPC data again, or [contact the Digital Land team](mailto:DigitalLand@communities.gov.uk) if you’re interested in EPC data.
