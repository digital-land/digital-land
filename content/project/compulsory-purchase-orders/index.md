A [compulsory purchase order](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/compulsory-purchase-process-and-the-crichel-down-rules-guidance) (CPO) is a tool that can be used by certain bodies to authorise the acquisition of land and property. Its use can help make possible a wide range of development, regeneration and infrastructure projects, where there is a compelling case in the public interest.

The Secretary of State is responsible for taking decisions on the approval of CPOs. There is currently no central, publicly accessible register of these decisions or how they were arrived at. As part of its commitment to create one, the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government is working to design a data format for publishing its CPO data so that it’s easy to find, use and trust.
