## Timeline

**02 July 2019**

Paul [created a script](https://gist.github.com/psd/2361887a4c725adcd311ed7e7ec6d0fa) which extracted the key information from the formatted MS Excel report and translated into a .csv file. From this we've been able to start modeling how the register may work.

**27 June 2019**

We re-visited the team in Birmingham with a goal of extracting historic CPO data from the legacy system. It was a successful trip, although the limitations of the system meant that the reports were only available in a formatted MS Excel file.

**19 June 2019**

We met with the planning caseworker team in Birmingham to understand more about the existing and legacy systems used to manage CPOs. We explored what data is entered and how we can extract the data with a view of making it publicly available.

**28 May 2019**

We met with colleagues from the compulsory purchase orders policy team, the planning inspectorate and planning casework unit to understand more about the process of raising a CPO, and to explore the opportunities of opening up their data.

**Spring 2019**

We are planning a discovery workshop with the policy team, Planning Inspectorate and the Planning Caseworker Unit to identify user needs and agree next steps.
