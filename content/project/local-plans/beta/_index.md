The Digital Land team started work on the local plans [beta phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works) in July 2020, looking at building a national dataset of local plans and policies.

This work builds on the outputs and recommendations from the [local plans alpha phase](https://digital-land.github.io/project/local-plans/alpha/) the team ran with [dxw](https://www.dxw.com/) and the [Planning Advisory Service](https://local.gov.uk/pas).

Working with the Planning directorate in The Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government (MHCLG), we aim to:

- define a [specification for publishing data about local plan making](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/dataset/local-plans/)
- create guidance and tools to help local planning authorities publish information about their local plans as data
- collect and present this information, to form a national dataset of local planning policies which can be visualised in a [dashboard, and on a map](https://local-plan.herokuapp.com/v3/plan-data)
- build a roadmap for developing further standards and specifications for publishing local plan making policies as data
