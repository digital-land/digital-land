## Current areas of investigation

The following areas of investigation explore how the data could be used and made easier to work with:

{{< in-progress-issue title="A timetable for local plan production" number="61" >}}

#### Questions we’re asking

There is no central record of where local planning authorities are in the process of producing their local plans. Would creating one be useful to users of local plans?  What would a useful one record of local plan production look like?

#### What we're testing

Our current [local plan explorer](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/local-plans) allows planning authorities to update their planning timetables and others to view it.

#### What we've learned

We are continuing to test the prototype and analyse our findings for this area of investigation.

{{< in-progress-issue title="A resource showing local authorities’ targets for housing units" number="62" >}}

#### Questions we’re asking

There is no central resource indicating the number of housing units each local planning authority has promised. Would it be possible to aggregate this data accurately and what form would be most useful to potential users of this data?

See our [project page on housing numbers](https://digital-land.github.io/project/housing-numbers/) to find out what we're testing and what we've learned so far.

{{< in-progress-issue title="A record of geographies in local plans" number="63" >}}

#### Questions we're asking

Local plans contain data mapped to geographical areas. While useful, they can be difficult to extract as data. Would it be possible to build a central record of geographies in local plans? Would this be useful to users of data – and what would it look like?

#### What we're testing

As part of our project on housing numbers we’ve collected the number of new houses that planning authorities have committed to in their local plans. We’ve developed a tool that makes this data available on [a clickable map of England](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/local-plans/map-of-data).

#### What we've learned

We are continuing to test the prototype and analyse our findings for this area of investigation.

## Timeline

**March - May 2019**

We are meeting with local authorities across the country to understand the different Local Plan making processes, the challenges faced by those involved, and the data used throughout the process. This is a key part of our research into how digital tools could support the process of collecting and publishing data, and making local plans.

**24 April 2019**

We met with the [Planning Inspectorate](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/planning-inspectorate) to learn about their involvement in monitoring emerging plans.

**23 April 2019**

We met with [Dorset Council](https://www.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk) to learn about their plan-making process.

**10 April 2019**

We met with [Camden Council](https://www.camden.gov.uk/) to learn about their plan-making process.

**28 February 2019**

We ran a workshop with the planning policy team to learn about their needs around creating, monitoring and reviewing local plans.

**February 2019**

We started the discovery phase.

**10 January 2019**

We attended the ‘Answering the Housing Land Question - Building a Knowledge Base’ conference in Reading and participated in a panel on ‘Land: The State of Data and Information Availability’.
