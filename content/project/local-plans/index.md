[Local plans](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/plan-making) set out local planning policies, identify how land is used, and decide what will be built where. They are a rich source of information, but the equally useful data used to produce them isn’t easily extracted. For example, a local plan might show a map of where housing will be built, but the data that made the map (such as addresses and coordinates) is not made available.


The Digital Land team and policy specialists at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are working with local planning authorities to design a data format for publishing local plan data so that it’s easy to find, use and trust.

## Current areas of investigation

The following areas of investigation demonstrate possible ways the data might be applied and made easier to work with:

{{< in-progress-issue title="A timetable for local plan production" number="61" >}}

#### Questions we’re asking

There is no central record of where local planning authorities are in the process of producing their local plans. Would creating one be useful to users of local plans?  What would a useful one record of local plan production look like?

#### What we're testing

Our current [local plan explorer](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/local-plans) allows planning authorities to update their planning timetables and others to view it.

#### What we've learned

We are continuing to test the prototype and analyse our findings for this area of investigation.

{{< in-progress-issue title="A resource showing local authorities’ targets for housing units" number="62" >}}

#### Questions we’re asking

There is no central resource indicating the number of housing units each local planning authority has promised. Would it be possible to aggregate this data accurately and what form would be most useful to potential users of this data?

See our [project page on housing numbers](https://digital-land.github.io/project/housing-numbers/) to find out what we're testing and what we've learned so far.

{{< in-progress-issue title="A record of geographies in local plans" number="63" >}}

#### Questions we're asking

Local plans contain data mapped to geographical areas. While useful, they can be difficult to extract as data. Would it be possible to build a central record of geographies in local plans? Would this be useful to users of data – and what would it look like?

#### What we're testing

As part of our project on housing numbers we’ve collected the number of new houses that planning authorities have committed to in their local plans. We’ve developed a tool that makes this data available on [a clickable map of England](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/local-plans/map-of-data).

#### What we've learned

We are continuing to test the prototype and analyse our findings for this area of investigation.

## Timeline

**10 January 2019**

We attended the ‘Answering the Housing Land Question - Building a Knowledge Base’ conference in Reading and participated in a panel on ‘Land: The State of Data and Information Availability’.
