### Who we are
We’re a team of digital and policy specialists in the [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government).

### Our mission
By making land and housing data easier to find, use and trust, we aim to make it easier for:

* everyone involved in land and housing development to make better informed decisions

* communities to better understand and engage with development decisions in their area

* PropTech companies to create new digital services for the marketplace

* local authorities to record decisions and report data, freeing up their limited resources

* policy teams in MHCLG to create policy based on high quality, relevant data

### Our vision
We are developing a suite of free digital services that will help unlock land and housing data’s potential for everyone involved in land and housing development. Improving data will help open up the housing market to smaller businesses and help transform the relationship between planners, developers and communities.

Our digital design service for policymakers will help them get the land and housing data they need to make decisions, while making it easy for local authorities to record decisions and report that data and for anyone with an interest in land and housing development to find, use and trust it.

### How we work
We work as a digital team, meaning we develop our services iteratively, using agile methodology. This means we start with a minimum viable service and add features on according to validated user needs, based on user research. We test everything we make with users until we’re satisfied it meets those needs. We build in small increments, which reduces risk.

### Our values 

We are accountable and open.

We welcome critical debate.

We own our expertise but share the work.

We always assume everyone in the team is trying their best.

We succeed or fail as a team.

We self-organise around clear objectives.

We are comfortable with uncertainty.
