## Headlines

* Creating and validating a basic model of planning applications, with information and insights from our Discovery phase user research interviews thus far.

## Last sprint we…

* Kicked off the project! See [this blog post](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/kicking-off-the-planning-permissions-project/).
* Created a draft roadmap for the Discovery and Alpha phases of this work.
* Arranged and held 7+ stakeholder and user research interviews to find out more about the lifecycle of a planning application, the data links around planning applications and permissions, the schema that existing planning application/permissions viewing tools have, what kinds of people make use of planning applications/permissions data, and how a central government data source might be able to help them.

## This sprint we will…

* Continue to speak with stakeholders and users about these questions.
* Refine our discovery research focus as we get more insights from the interviews.
* Adjust our model of planning submissions and draft some ideas of how to link the data around the site and the submissions together.

## What we’re thinking:

* There is a lot of jargon and various terms around planning permissions - can we create a set of common terms and definitions to use consistently?
* How might we link planning submissions together?
* How could a user check on start, progress, and completion of a planned site?
* How might we get more structured data flowing through the system?

## And finally…

* There has been a lot of work in this area already, and we are researching and talking to people who have worked on products around planning applications and permissions, e.g. [Planning Alerts](https://github.com/openaustralia/planningalerts/blob/master/app/models/application.rb), [Adrian Short’s scraper](https://github.com/adrianshort/uk_planning_scraper/blob/master/lib/uk_planning_scraper/application.rb), [PlanIt](http://planit.org.uk/dictionary/) and [PlanningFinder](https://www.planningfinder.co.uk/). We need to learn from previous successes, challenges, and lessons learned. Let us know if you have a connection or idea of someone we could talk to in our research!
